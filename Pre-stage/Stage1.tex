\section{Introduction}
In recent years, Large Language Models(LLMs) has become a hot topic in the field of Natural Language Processing. In general research, Visual Spatatial Reasoning is mostly used on Visual Question Answering(VQA) and Visual Commonsense Reasoning(VCR), and Most of the research is testing on the Visual Language Models(VLMs)
