\section{Project Description}

In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with their impressive achievements. These models, which have been trained on extensive amounts of text data, have proven to be highly effective in solving various NLP tasks, like translating languages, answering questions, and generating text. Their ability to understand and create text that resembles human language has been truly remarkable and easy to appreciate.

However, despite their proficiency in many linguistic tasks, LLMs have faced challenges when it comes to Spatial Reasoning. Unlike tasks that focus solely on language, Spatial Reasoning involves comprehending and manipulating visual and spatial information. To shed light on this limitation, I plan to conduct an experiment using popular LLMs like GPT-4\cite{peng2023instruction}. The main goal will be to test how well they can handle Visual Spatial Reasoning, which is important for understanding the relationships between objects in visual content.

The experiment will center around a commonly used task called Visual Question Answering (VQA). This task requires machines to answer questions based on provided images. For example, when given an image showing different objects, the machine will be given inquiries such as "What is the spatial relationship between object A and object B?". By designing carefully constructed tests like these, we can assess the level of Spatial Reasoning ability demonstrated by LLMs in an easy-to-understand manner.

Through evaluating their performance in VQA and their capacity to comprehend and reason about spatial relationships in visual content, we can gain valuable insights into the Spatial Reasoning capabilities of LLMs. These findings will not only enhance our understanding of the strengths and limitations of these models but also pave the way for further advancements in NLP. This progress will bring us closer to developing more comprehensive and versatile language models that are accessible and easy to work with.

\section{Key Literature and Background Reading}

Spatial Reasoning plays a fundamental role in commonsense reasoning, dating back to the Naive Physics enterprise\cite{Hobbs1985-HOBFTO}. Extensive research has been conducted on the representation of qualitative spatial reasoning\cite{chen2015survey}, exploring various methods for representing spatial relations in both 2D and 3D spaces. Building upon these foundations, Spatial Reasoning encompasses several key aspects, including (i) mereotopology, (ii) direction and orientation, (iii) size, (iv) distance, and (v) shape, as discussed by Cohn et al. (2008) in their qualitative analysis\cite{cohn2008qualitative}.

To evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Spatial Reasoning, Cohn et al. (2023) developed a comprehensive Spatial Reasoning test that covers essential spatial relations, such as parthood, rotation, and direction, as well as size, shape, location, affordances, object interaction, and object permanence\cite{cohn2023dialectical}. Their findings revealed inconsistencies in LLMs' responses to the same question across multiple sessions, indicating that LLMs struggle to maintain consistency in Spatial Reasoning tasks. Here is an example prompt and response from their study:
\begin{quote}
    Prompt-5.1: \emph{If a circle b is larger than a circle c, is it possible to move b so that it is entirely contained by c?}

    GPT-3.5turbo response:\emph{Yes, it is possible to move a larger circle (b) so that it is entirely contained by a smaller circle (c). To do this, you would need to move the 
    center of circle b towards the center of circle c until the edge of circle b touches the edge of circle c. As long as the radius of circle b is smaller than the distance between the centers of the two circles, it is possible to move circle b in this way so that it is entirely contained by circle c. Itâ€™s important to note that in order for circle b to be entirely contained by circle c, the radius of circle b must be less than or equal to the 
    difference between the radii of circle c and circle b.}
\end{quote}

In a related study by Lin et al. (2023), a test was devised to evaluate LLMs' Spatial Reasoning abilities with a focus on mathematical representation of questions \cite{lin2023using}. Their research demonstrated that while LLMs may not excel at directly answering spatial questions, they exhibit proficiency in transforming questions into mathematical forms based on user demands.

Moreover, Borji (2023) proposed a failure task category for ChatGPT, within which Spatial Reasoning was highlighted \cite{borji2023categorical}. In this task, the researcher provided a grid description and asked the model to find a path from a start point to an end point. However, the model failed to answer the question accurately, highlighting its limitations in Spatial Reasoning tasks.

Besides, an additional area of research closely connected to Spatial Reasoning is Theory-of-Mind (ToM). Theory-of-Mind entails comprehending and reasoning about the mental states of individuals, encompassing their beliefs, intentions, and desires. It requires a common-sense understanding of Spatial Reasoning to grasp the spatial relationship between agents and objects. The investigation revealed that despite their remarkable language capabilities, LLMs encounter difficulties when confronted with Theory-of-Mind tasks involving trivial alterations. Trivial alterations denote minor modifications in the task settings or presented scenarios \cite{ullman2023large}.

Collectively, these studies shed light on the challenges LLMs face when it comes to Spatial Reasoning, including inconsistencies in responses, struggles with direct spatial question answering, and difficulties in solving specific spatial tasks like path finding. 

An essential consideration lies in the domain of Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) and its intrinsic significance within the realm of Visual Language Models (VLMs), which constitutes a distinct sphere divergent from the purview of LLMs. It is of utmost importance to underscore the extensive body of research pertaining to this domain. VLMs, in stark contrast to their LLM counterparts, assume a multifaceted disposition as they amalgamate both visual and textual information, wherein images and text coalesce to effectuate various tasks. Notable exemplars of such triumphant VLMs include ViLBERT \cite{li2019visualbert}, LXMERT \cite{tan2019lxmert}, and UNITER \cite{chen2020uniter}, whose architectural frameworks are vividly depicted in Figure \ref{fig:VLMs}.

    \caption{Architectural of ViLBERT, LXMERT, and UNITER.}
    \label{fig:VLMs}
\end{figure}

Researchers have dedicated efforts to assess the ability of VLMs in comprehending commonsense spatial reasoning. Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks have been employed to evaluate the performance of VLMs in answering questions that involve spatial relationships between objects depicted in images\cite{7410636}. Consequently, various benchmarks and question sets have been developed to specifically evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs.

For instance, Liu et al. (2022) meticulously curated an extensive dataset comprising more than 10,000 text-image pairs, encompassing a remarkable range of 66 distinct types of spatial relations \cite{liu2022visual}. Through their comprehensive evaluation, encompassing both human subjects and Virtual Language Models (VLMs), they illuminated the notable disparity between VLMs and human performance in this intricate task. Furthermore, to comprehensively assess the spatial reasoning capacities of VLMs, various benchmarks have been developed.

(2021) it asks VLMs to give potential position between car and man. \cite{liu2022things}.}
  \label{fig:spatial_reasoning_benchmarks}
\end{figure*}

One such benchmark, GQA \cite{hudson2019gqa}, delves into the domain of question generation, pushing the boundaries of VLMs' ability to generate relevant questions. AGQA \cite{grunde2021agqa}, on the other hand, extends the evaluation to include video-based data, capturing the nuances of spatial reasoning in dynamic visual contexts. The Compositional Visual Relations Dataset \cite{zerroug2022benchmark} was meticulously constructed with a focus on Compositional Visual Relations (CVR), challenging VLMs with intricate visual relationships. VALSE \cite{parcalabescu2021valse} places its emphasis on unraveling the sensitivity of VLMs in spatial reasoning tasks, aiming to uncover their aptitude for subtle distinctions.

Furthermore, Liu et al. (2021) introduced a benchmark \cite{liu2022things} that scrutinizes the relative scales of objects, enabling a deeper exploration of VLMs' comprehension of spatial proportions. To capture a richer spectrum of spatial phenomena, SpartQA \cite{mirzaee2021spartqa} was meticulously devised, providing a challenging arena for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.

Figure \ref{fig:spatial_reasoning_benchmarks} showcases a glimpse of these remarkable benchmarks, highlighting the efforts undertaken to assess and comprehend the spatial reasoning prowess of VLMs.


These benchmarks and datasets serve as valuable tools to assess the progress and limitations of VLMs in the realm of spatial reasoning and they have such things in common: (i) they are all based on commonsense spatial reasoning, (ii) they all focus on VLMs, (iii) they all only ask LLMs to use simple answers to these questions, like "yes" or "no", and (iv) they all given some bound words to the model to help it understand the spatial relations. However, in my research, I will focus on LLMs and their Spatial Reasoning capabilities, which is a distinct topic from VLMs. 

In conclusion, this literature review presents a thorough examination of the current landscape in the realm of LLMs and their Spatial Reasoning capabilities. It consolidates recent research from the fields of LLMs, Spatial Reasoning, and VQA, providing an in-depth analysis of the advancements made thus far. The review sheds light on the existing limitations and challenges that LLMs encounter when comprehending and reasoning about spatial relationships in visual content. Moreover, it offers valuable insights into potential strategies for enhancing LLMs' Spatial Reasoning abilities. By synthesizing these findings, this review contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the art in LLMs' Spatial Reasoning capabilities and paves the way for future advancements in this field.

\section{Development and Implementation Summary}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Experiment Design}
For the experimental stage, the workflow can be visualized as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:workflow}. The experiment is divided into three distinct parts, each serving a specific purpose:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare Stage}
    \subitem During this stage, the primary objective is to gather a diverse collection of images that contain various spatial relations. These images can be sourced from the internet or generated using appropriate tools. For this project, the dataset will consist of a combination of an existing benchmark proposed by Liu et al. (2022) \cite{liu2022visual}.
    Another crucial aspect is the question set, which will be divided into two parts:
    (i) Questions discussing the spatial relationships between objects depicted in the images.
    (ii) Questions requiring the reasoning steps behind the previous answers.
    \item \textbf{Experiment Stage}
    \subitem The focus of this stage is to test different versions of Large Language Models (LLMs) using the prepared dataset and question set. The LLMs will be evaluated based on two factors:
    (i) Different sizes of LLMs.
    (ii) Different pre-training methods of LLMs.
    The experiment will involve running the LLMs on the prepared dataset, recording the results, and analyzing their performance. And all testing models will be GPT models, including from GPT-3.5 tubor to GPT-4-0612.
    \item \textbf{Analysis and Evaluation Stage}

    (ii) The reasoning steps generated by the LLMs.
    Based on the accuracy, the effectiveness and capability of the LLMs in spatial reasoning can be evaluated and compared. By examining the reasoning steps, any limitations and challenges faced by LLMs in comprehending and reasoning about spatial relationships in visual content can be identified.
\end{enumerate}

Through this systematic workflow, the experiment aims to assess the performance and capabilities of various versions of LLMs in spatial reasoning tasks. The analysis and evaluation stage provide insights into the strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement in LLMs' understanding and reasoning abilities pertaining to spatial relationships in visual content.

\subsection{Code Implementation}
There is no code implementation in this project. All the experiments will be conducted on the website of OpenAI. The code of this project will be written in Python, and the code will be used to prepare the dataset and question set, and to analyze the results of the experiment.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./pic/workflow.drawio.png}
    \caption{Workflow of the experiment}
    \label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}

\section{User Interface Mockup}
For this project, there is no user interface mockup. All the experiments will be conducted on the website of OpenAI. The code of this project will be written in Python, and the code will be used to prepare the dataset and question set, and to analyze the results of the experiment.

\section{Data Sources}
The data utilized in this project will be divided into two main parts: the dataset and question set, and the answers generated by the Large Language Models (LLMs).

For the dataset and question set, a combination of existing benchmarks proposed by Liu et al. (2022) \cite{liu2022visual} and self-generated images will be used. The images in the dataset will encompass real-world objects along with 2D shapes, ensuring a diverse range of spatial relationships to be examined. The benchmark images are extracted from the COCO 2017 dataset \cite{lin2014microsoft}, which is an open-source dataset widely used in computer vision research. It is important to note that the usage of the COCO dataset has been granted full permission for this project.

As for the second part, the answers generated by the LLMs will be stored in a text file. The answers will be generated using the OpenAI website, which provides a platform for executing queries and obtaining responses from the language model. The generated answers can be conveniently downloaded as a text file from the website or saved directly on the platform.

By utilizing this comprehensive data setup, incorporating a combination of benchmark images and self-generated content, along with leveraging the power of LLMs to generate answers, the project aims to provide an extensive and diverse set of data for analysis and evaluation. The combination of the benchmark dataset and the generated answers will enable the project to assess the performance and capabilities of the LLMs in spatial reasoning tasks accurately.

It is important to ensure adherence to proper data usage policies, including obtaining necessary permissions for the benchmark dataset and complying with any licensing or attribution requirements associated with the dataset. This approach ensures the project's integrity and ethical practices while utilizing publicly available data resources for research purposes.

\section{Testing}

\section{Evaluation}
\section{Ethical Considerations}
As researchers and developers explore the capabilities of LLMs in visual spatial reasoning, it is crucial to consider and address several ethical considerations associated with this technology. These considerations are necessary to ensure responsible and ethical use of LLMs in the context of visual spatial reasoning. Some key ethical considerations include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Bias and Fairness: LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data, and if the training data contains biases, the models can inadvertently perpetuate and amplify those biases. Care should be taken to identify and mitigate biases related to spatial relationships, objects, or cultural aspects in the training data. Fairness and inclusivity should be prioritized to avoid marginalization or discrimination based on race, gender, socioeconomic status, or any other protected characteristics.
    \item Data Privacy and Security: When collecting or using datasets for visual spatial reasoning tasks, it is essential to respect privacy rights and comply with data protection regulations. Any personally identifiable information (PII) should be handled with care, and proper anonymization techniques should be employed to protect the privacy of individuals represented in the data. Additionally, robust security measures should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    \item Informed Consent: If human subjects are involved in data collection or evaluation processes, informed consent should be obtained. Participants should be fully informed about the purpose of the study, the data collection methods, and any potential risks or implications associated with their participation. Participants should have the freedom to withdraw their consent at any point during the study.
    \item Transparency and Explainability: LLMs often operate as black boxes, making it challenging to understand how they arrive at their answers or reasoning steps. It is important to develop methods and techniques that enhance the transparency and explainability of LLMs' decision-making processes in visual spatial reasoning. This helps build trust and allows users to better understand the models' behavior and potential limitations.
    \item Human-AI Collaboration: While LLMs can provide valuable insights and assist in visual spatial reasoning, it is crucial to acknowledge the importance of human expertise and maintain a human-centric approach. LLMs should be viewed as tools to augment human capabilities rather than replacing human decision-making or responsibility. Collaboration between humans and AI should be encouraged to ensure that decisions made based on LLM-generated outputs are critically evaluated and aligned with ethical standards.
    \item Accountability and Governance: As LLMs become more sophisticated, it is important to establish accountability mechanisms and governance frameworks to address any potential risks or unintended consequences. This may include adopting standards, guidelines, or regulatory frameworks specific to the development and deployment of LLMs in visual spatial reasoning applications. Responsible and ethical practices should be promoted throughout the entire lifecycle of LLM development and deployment.
\end{enumerate}
These ethical considerations serve as a starting point for ensuring the responsible and ethical use of LLMs in visual spatial reasoning. It is crucial for researchers, developers, and stakeholders to actively engage in ongoing discussions, collaborate with interdisciplinary teams, and adhere to ethical guidelines to mitigate potential harms and maximize the benefits of this technology in a responsible manner.
