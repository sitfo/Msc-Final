\section{Project Description}
In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved great success in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The LLMs are trained on large-scale text corpus, and can be used to solve many NLP tasks, such as machine translation, question answering, and text generation. The LLMs are usually trained on text corpus, and can be used to solve many NLP tasks, such as machine translation, question answering, and text generation.\\
However, the LLMs are not good at solving the Spatial Reasoning tasks. In this project, I will design an experiment for most popular LLMs, such as GPT-4, to test their ability of Visual Spatial Reasoning. The experiment will be based on the Visual Question Answering (VQA)--a task that requires the machine to answer questions about the given image. For example, given an image with different objects, the machine needs to answer the question "What the relevant position of the object A to the object B?". With these tests, we can evaluate what level of Spatial Reasoning ability the LLMs have.\\
