\section{Project Description}
In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with their impressive achievements. These models, which have been trained on extensive amounts of text data, have proven to be highly effective in solving various NLP tasks, like translating languages, answering questions, and generating text. Their ability to understand and create text that resembles human language has been truly remarkable and easy to appreciate.

However, despite their proficiency in many linguistic tasks, LLMs have faced challenges when it comes to Spatial Reasoning. Unlike tasks that focus solely on language, Spatial Reasoning involves comprehending and manipulating visual and spatial information. To shed light on this limitation, I plan to conduct an experiment using popular LLMs like GPT-4\cite{peng2023instruction}. The main goal will be to test how well they can handle Visual Spatial Reasoning, which is important for understanding the relationships between objects in visual content.

The experiment will center around a commonly used task called Visual Question Answering (VQA). This task requires machines to answer questions based on provided images. For example, when given an image showing different objects, the machine will be given inquiries such as "What is the spatial relationship between object A and object B?". By designing carefully constructed tests like these, we can assess the level of Spatial Reasoning ability demonstrated by LLMs in an easy-to-understand manner.

Through evaluating their performance in VQA and their capacity to comprehend and reason about spatial relationships in visual content, we can gain valuable insights into the Spatial Reasoning capabilities of LLMs. These findings will not only enhance our understanding of the strengths and limitations of these models but also pave the way for further advancements in NLP. This progress will bring us closer to developing more comprehensive and versatile language models that are accessible and easy to work with.

\section{Aims and Objectives}
In this section, we will provide a clear outline of the aims and objectives of this project. The aims represent the overarching goals that we aim to achieve, while the objectives outline the specific steps and milestones that will be undertaken to fulfill these goals. The aims and objectives of this project are outlined below:

\section{Output}
In this experiment, There are three LLM models have been tested: Visual ChatGPT\cite{wu2023visual}, Bard and MiniGPT-4\cite{zhu2023minigpt4}. For the test form is shown as Table \ref{tab:question_template}, and there are 80 question sets divided into two parts: Easy and Hard. They divided by the objects in the image. If the objects no more than 5 and the spatial relationship is simple, it will be easy. Otherwise, it will be hard. The question sets and outputs are shown in Appendix \ref{Easy} and \ref{Hard}.
\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Question Template}
    \label{tab:question_template}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{0.4\linewidth}|p{0.5\linewidth}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Input Image} &\textbf{Question}\\
        \hline
        \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../image set/hard/000000104739.jpg} \end{center}
        & \begin{enumerate}
            \item Can you describe the spatial relationship between these two laptops?
            \item Is this black laptop on the left of the white laptop?
            \item Show me your specific reasoning steps that lead you to the answer, better in detailed explanation.
        \end{enumerate}\\
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
\end{table}

For these three questions: the first one is to test the model's ability to understand the spatial relationship between two objects. The second one is to test the model's ability to answer the question with directly leading words. The third one is to test the model's ability to explain the answer. The reason of abandoning the accuracy of the first question is that Bard uses a tricky strategy to answer the question: It gives you all the possible answers to the question, which is hard to define the answer is right or wrong, and not fair to other models.
So the accuracy is the based on the second question, first and third are used to evaluate the model's ability of understanding and reasoning. The accuracy of the three models is shown in Table \ref{tab:accuracy}. And the detailed accuracy charts are shown by Table \ref{tab:easy-acc} and \ref{tab:hard-acc}
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Accuracy of Three Models}
    \label{tab:accuracy}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{Model} & Easy      & Hard & Total \\ \midrule
    Bard                      &  $42.5\%$ & $45.0\%$ &  $43.75\%$ \\
    Visual ChatGPT            &  $55.0\%$ & $60.0\%$ &  $57.5\%$  \\
    MiniGPT-4                 &  $62.5\%$ & $52.5\%$ &  $57.5\%$  \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

From the accuracy chart, we can see that the accuracy of the three models is not high.
