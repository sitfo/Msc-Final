%%%%  ABSTRACT
\chapter*{\center Abstract}

In the contemporary landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as revolutionary entities, reshaping the domain with their unparalleled accomplishments. A burgeoning area of research within this realm is the exploration of LLMs' Spatial Reasoning capabilities, particularly their efficacy in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. This paper introduces a meticulously curated VQA dataset comprising 80 images, bifurcated into two distinct categories: 'Easy' and 'Hard'. This dataset serves as a crucible to evaluate the Visual Spatial Reasoning proficiencies of three preeminent models: Bard, Visual ChatGPT, and MiniGPT-4. We embark on a rigorous examination of the responses generated by these models, ensuring a holistic understanding of their capabilities. Subsequent to this analysis, we delve into an in-depth discourse on the Spatial Reasoning competencies of the aforementioned models, elucidating their strengths and areas of potential improvement. Concluding our study, we proffer prospective directions that could further augment the Spatial Reasoning capacities of LLMs, paving the way for more nuanced and sophisticated applications in the future.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}

In the contemporary landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as pivotal entities, revolutionizing the domain with their unparalleled proficiencies. These state-of-the-art models, underpinned by vast textual datasets, have demonstrated exceptional efficacy across a spectrum of NLP tasks, encompassing language translation, query resolution, and text generation. The remarkable semblance of their outputs to human-like language articulation stands as a testament to their sophistication.

Yet, for all their linguistic prowess, LLMs encounter significant hurdles in the realm of Spatial Reasoning. Contrary to tasks that are predominantly linguistic, Spatial Reasoning mandates the comprehension and manipulation of visual and spatial constructs. To elucidate these constraints, an empirical study is proposed, leveraging renowned LLMs such as GPT-4\cite{peng2023instruction}. The primary objective is to gauge their adeptness in Visual Spatial Reasoning, a crucial competency for discerning inter-object relationships within visual contexts.

Central to this investigation is the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, a widely-adopted benchmark that necessitates machine responses to queries anchored in visual stimuli. For instance, presented with an illustrative depiction of diverse objects, the model might be probed with questions like "What is the spatial relationship between object A and object B?". Through such methodically designed evaluations, the Spatial Reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be systematically assessed.

By critically appraising their VQA performance and their aptitude to interpret and reason spatial interrelations in visual content, invaluable insights into LLMs' Spatial Reasoning faculties can be gleaned. Such revelations not only enrich the understanding of these models' capabilities and constraints but also chart a course for future NLP innovations. Ultimately, this endeavor seeks to foster the evolution of holistic and versatile language models that are both robust and user-friendly.

%%%%  BACKGROUND

\chapter{Background}\label{chap:background}
Spatial Reasoning plays a fundamental role in commonsense reasoning, dating back to the Naive Physics enterprise\cite{Hobbs1985-HOBFTO}. Extensive research has been conducted on the representation of qualitative spatial reasoning\cite{chen2015survey}, exploring various methods for representing spatial relations in both 2D and 3D spaces.


Building upon these foundations, Spatial Reasoning encompasses several key aspects, including (i) mereotopology, (ii) direction and orientation, (iii) size, (iv) distance, and (v) shape, as discussed by Cohn et al. (2008) in their qualitative analysis\cite{cohn2008qualitative}. These aspects should be judged simultaneously to determine the spatial relationship between two objects. For example, to determine whether a circle is larger than a square, we must consider both the size and shape of the objects. 

To evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Spatial Reasoning, Cohn et al. (2023) developed a comprehensive Spatial Reasoning test that covers essential spatial relations, such as parthood, rotation, and direction, as well as size, shape, location, affordances, object interaction, and object permanence\cite{cohn2023dialectical}. Their findings revealed inconsistencies in LLMs' responses to the same question across multiple sessions, indicating that LLMs struggle to maintain consistency in Spatial Reasoning tasks. Here is an example prompt and response from their study:
\begin{quotation}
    Prompt-5.1: \emph{If a circle b is larger than a circle c, is it possible to move b so that it is entirely contained by c?}

    GPT-3.5turbo response:\emph{Yes, it is possible to move a larger circle (b) so that it is entirely contained by a smaller circle (c). To do this, you would need to move the 
    center of circle b towards the center of circle c until the edge of circle b touches the edge of circle c. As long as the radius of circle b is smaller than the distance between the centers of the two circles, it is possible to move circle b in this way so that it is entirely contained by circle c. It’s important to note that in order for circle b to be entirely contained by circle c, the radius of circle b must be less than or equal to the 
    difference between the radii of circle c and circle b.}
\end{quotation}

In a related study by Lin et al. (2023), a test was devised to evaluate LLMs' Spatial Reasoning abilities with a focus on mathematical representation of questions \cite{lin2023using}. Their research demonstrated that while LLMs may not excel at directly answering spatial questions, they exhibit proficiency in transforming questions into mathematical forms based on user demands.

Moreover, Borji (2023) proposed a failure task category for ChatGPT, within which Spatial Reasoning was highlighted \cite{borji2023categorical}. In this task, the researcher provided a grid description and asked the model to find a path from a start point to an end point. However, the model failed to answer the question accurately, highlighting its limitations in Spatial Reasoning tasks.

Besides, an additional area of research closely connected to Spatial Reasoning is Theory-of-Mind (ToM). Theory-of-Mind entails comprehending and reasoning about the mental states of individuals, encompassing their beliefs, intentions, and desires. It requires a common-sense understanding of Spatial Reasoning to grasp the spatial relationship between agents and objects. The investigation revealed that despite their remarkable language capabilities, LLMs encounter difficulties when confronted with Theory-of-Mind tasks involving trivial alterations. Trivial alterations denote minor modifications in the task settings or presented scenarios \cite{ullman2023large}.

Collectively, these studies shed light on the challenges LLMs face when it comes to Spatial Reasoning, including inconsistencies in responses, struggles with direct spatial question answering, and difficulties in solving specific spatial tasks like path finding. 

An essential consideration lies in the domain of Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) and its intrinsic significance within the realm of Visual Language Models (VLMs), which constitutes a distinct sphere divergent from the purview of LLMs. It is of utmost importance to underscore the extensive body of research pertaining to this domain. VLMs, in stark contrast to their LLM counterparts, assume a multifaceted disposition as they amalgamate both visual and textual information, wherein images and text coalesce to effectuate various tasks. Notable exemplars of such triumphant VLMs include ViLBERT \cite{li2019visualbert}, LXMERT \cite{tan2019lxmert}, and UNITER \cite{chen2020uniter}, whose architectural frameworks are vividly depicted in Figure \ref{fig:VLMs}.

    \caption{Architectural of ViLBERT, LXMERT, and UNITER.}
    \label{fig:VLMs}
\end{figure}

Researchers have dedicated efforts to assess the ability of VLMs in comprehending commonsense spatial reasoning. Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks have been employed to evaluate the performance of VLMs in answering questions that involve spatial relationships between objects depicted in images\cite{7410636}. Consequently, various benchmarks and question sets have been developed to specifically evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs.

For instance, Liu et al. (2022) meticulously curated an extensive dataset comprising more than 10,000 text-image pairs, encompassing a remarkable range of 66 distinct types of spatial relations \cite{liu2022visual}. Through their comprehensive evaluation, encompassing both human subjects and Virtual Language Models (VLMs), they illuminated the notable disparity between VLMs and human performance in this intricate task. Furthermore, to comprehensively assess the spatial reasoning capacities of VLMs, various benchmarks have been developed.

(2021) it asks VLMs to give potential position between car and man. \cite{liu2022things}.}
  \label{fig:spatial_reasoning_benchmarks}
\end{figure*}

One such benchmark, GQA \cite{hudson2019gqa}, delves into the domain of question generation, pushing the boundaries of VLMs' ability to generate relevant questions. AGQA \cite{grunde2021agqa}, on the other hand, extends the evaluation to include video-based data, capturing the nuances of spatial reasoning in dynamic visual contexts. The Compositional Visual Relations Dataset \cite{zerroug2022benchmark} was meticulously constructed with a focus on Compositional Visual Relations (CVR), challenging VLMs with intricate visual relationships. VALSE \cite{parcalabescu2021valse} places its emphasis on unraveling the sensitivity of VLMs in spatial reasoning tasks, aiming to uncover their aptitude for subtle distinctions.

Furthermore, Liu et al. (2021) introduced a benchmark \cite{liu2022things} that scrutinizes the relative scales of objects, enabling a deeper exploration of VLMs' comprehension of spatial proportions. To capture a richer spectrum of spatial phenomena, SpartQA \cite{mirzaee2021spartqa} was meticulously devised, providing a challenging arena for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.

Figure \ref{fig:spatial_reasoning_benchmarks} showcases a glimpse of these remarkable benchmarks, highlighting the efforts undertaken to assess and comprehend the spatial reasoning prowess of VLMs.

These benchmarks and datasets serve as valuable tools to assess the progress and limitations of VLMs in the realm of spatial reasoning and they have such things in common: (i) they are all based on commonsense spatial reasoning, (ii) they all focus on VLMs, (iii) they all only ask LLMs to use simple answers to these questions, like "yes" or "no", and (iv) they all given some bound words to the model to limit the model's answer space.

In conclusion, this literature review presents a thorough examination of the current landscape in the realm of LLMs and their Spatial Reasoning capabilities. It consolidates recent research from the fields of LLMs, Spatial Reasoning, and VQA, providing an in-depth analysis of the advancements made thus far. The review sheds light on the existing limitations and challenges that LLMs encounter when comprehending and reasoning about spatial relationships in visual content. Moreover, it offers valuable insights into potential strategies for enhancing LLMs' Spatial Reasoning abilities. By synthesizing these findings, this review contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the art in LLMs' Spatial Reasoning capabilities and paves the way for future advancements in this field.

%%%%  ETHICS

\chapter{Ethical Use of Data}\label{chap:ethics}

In this chapter, we will outline the ethical considerations that should be taken into account when conducting this project. The ethical considerations will be divided into two parts: the ethical use of data and the ethical use of LLMs.

\section{Data Sources}
The data utilized in this project will be divided into two main parts: the dataset and question set, and the answers generated by the Large Language Models (LLMs).

For the dataset and question set, a combination of existing benchmarks proposed by Liu et al. (2022) \cite{liu2022visual} and self-generated images will be used. The images in the dataset will encompass real-world objects along with 2D shapes, ensuring a diverse range of spatial relationships to be examined. The benchmark images are extracted from the COCO 2017 dataset \cite{lin2014microsoft}, which is an open-source dataset widely used in computer vision research. It is important to note that the usage of the COCO dataset has been granted full permission for this project.

As for the second part, the answers generated by the LLMs will be stored in a text file. The answers will be generated using the OpenAI website, which provides a platform for executing queries and obtaining responses from the language model. The generated answers can be conveniently downloaded as a text file from the website or saved directly on the platform.

By utilizing this comprehensive data setup, incorporating a combination of benchmark images and self-generated content, along with leveraging the power of LLMs to generate answers, the project aims to provide an extensive and diverse set of data for analysis and evaluation. The combination of the benchmark dataset and the generated answers will enable the project to assess the performance and capabilities of the LLMs in spatial reasoning tasks accurately.

It is important to ensure adherence to proper data usage policies, including obtaining necessary permissions for the benchmark dataset and complying with any licensing or attribution requirements associated with the dataset. This approach ensures the project's integrity and ethical practices while utilizing publicly available data resources for research purposes.\\

\section{Ethical Considerations}
In the pursuit of investigating the Spatial Reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the context of VQA, it is essential to address several ethical considerations. These considerations ensure the responsible and ethical utilization of LLMs in the research and development process, while also mitigating potential risks and promoting equitable outcomes. The following ethical considerations should be given due attention:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Bias and Fairness: LLMs rely on extensive amounts of training data, and if this data contains biases, the models may inadvertently perpetuate or amplify those biases. It is crucial to identify and address biases related to spatial relationships, objects, or cultural aspects within the training data. Fairness and inclusivity should be prioritized to avoid marginalization or discrimination based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, socioeconomic status, etc.
    \item Privacy and Confidentiality: Throughout the experiment, privacy rights and data protection regulations must be upheld. Careful attention should be given to the handling of any personally identifiable information (PII) and the implementation of appropriate anonymization techniques. Participants' privacy should be protected, and their data should be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.
    \item Informed Consent: If human participants are involved in the data collection or evaluation process, obtaining informed consent is imperative. Participants should receive clear and comprehensive information about the purpose, procedures, and potential risks associated with their participation. They should have the freedom to make an informed decision about their involvement and the right to withdraw their consent at any point during the experiment.
    \item Transparency and Explainability: LLMs often operate as black boxes, making it challenging to understand how they arrive at their answers or reasoning steps. Efforts should be made to enhance the transparency and explainability of LLMs' decision-making processes in the context of Visual Spatial Reasoning. This includes providing clear explanations of the models' functioning and ensuring that the generated answers are interpretable and understandable.
    \item Responsible Research Practices: Throughout the experiment, researchers should adhere to rigorous scientific methodologies, ensuring the reliability and validity of the findings. This involves maintaining transparency in reporting the methodology, results, and limitations of the study. Rigorous peer review and open scientific discourse should be encouraged to foster accountability and rigor in the research community.
    \item Ethical AI Governance: As the capabilities of LLMs continue to advance, it is crucial to establish governance frameworks and accountability mechanisms specific to the development and deployment of these models in Spatial Reasoning applications. This may involve considering ethical guidelines, standards, and regulations that promote responsible and ethical practices, thereby safeguarding against potential risks and unintended consequences.
\end{enumerate}
By addressing these ethical considerations, researchers can ensure the responsible exploration of LLMs' Spatial Reasoning capabilities and contribute to the development of ethical guidelines in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Moreover, these considerations uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and respect for individual rights, fostering a trustworthy and beneficial environment for both researchers and participants involved in such studies.

%%%%  DESIGN

\chapter{Design}\label{chap:design}

In this chapter, we will elucidate the experimental design framework. This framework is methodically segmented into three distinct phases: the preparatory phase, the experimental execution phase, and the subsequent analysis and evaluation phase. Subsequently, a comparative analysis will be undertaken to highlight the modifications made from the initial design blueprint.

\section{Original design}\label{chap:first_design}
For the experimental stage, the workflow can be visualized as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:workflow}. The experiment is divided into three distinct parts, each serving a specific purpose:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./pic/workflow.drawio.png}
    \caption{Workflow of the experiment}
    \label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare Stage}
    \subitem During this stage, the primary objective is to gather a diverse collection of images that contain various spatial relations. These images can be sourced from the internet or generated using appropriate tools. For this project, the dataset will consist of a combination of an existing benchmark proposed by Liu et al. (2022) \cite{liu2022visual}.
    Another crucial aspect is the question set, which will be divided into three parts:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Questions discussing the spatial relationships between objects depicted in the images.
        \item Questions requiring the reasoning steps behind the previous answers.
        \item Questions sets following the guidelines proposed by Burnell et al. (2023) and Davis(2023) \cite{burnell2023rethink,davis2023benchmarks}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Experiment Stage}
    \subitem The focus of this stage is to test different versions of Large Language Models (LLMs) using the prepared dataset and question set. The LLMs will be evaluated based on two factors:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Different sizes of LLMs.
        \item Different pre-training methods of LLMs.
    \end{itemize}
    The experiment will involve running the LLMs on the prepared dataset, recording the results, and analyzing their performance.
    \item \textbf{Analysis and Evaluation Stage}
    \subitem In this stage, the emphasis is on analyzing the performance of the different versions of LLMs using the prepared dataset. The analysis will primarily consider two aspects:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The accuracy of the answers provided by the LLMs.
        \item The reasoning steps generated by the LLMs.
    \end{itemize}
    Based on the accuracy, the effectiveness and capability of the LLMs in spatial reasoning can be evaluated and compared. By examining the reasoning steps, any limitations and challenges faced by LLMs in comprehending and reasoning about spatial relationships in visual content can be identified.
\end{enumerate}

Through this systematic workflow, the experiment aims to assess the performance and capabilities of various versions of LLMs in spatial reasoning tasks. The analysis and evaluation stage provide insights into the strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement in LLMs' understanding and reasoning abilities pertaining to spatial relationships in visual content.

\subsection{Model Selection}
This project is specifically centered around Visual ChatGPT models, leveraging their innovative and convenient features that combine the visual context from images with textual data from questions\cite{wu2023visual}. While several models, including VLMs such as ViLBERT, LXMERT, UNITER, and VL-BERT, are well-equipped to handle VQA tasks, they often require deployment on local machines or servers. Moreover, they necessitate high-performance GPUs and considerable hard drive space.

Unfortunately, the budget for this project does not accommodate the procurement of high-performance GPUs. Given these constraints, the Visual ChatGPT models emerge as the optimal choice for this project, striking a balance between performance and resource requirements.

Another potential candidate is the miniGPT-4 model\cite{zhu2023minigpt4}. Developed with a frozen visual encoder and a frozen LLM, Vicuna, it offers considerable capabilities. However, with the shutdown of its online demo service, the miniGPT-4 model would also need to be deployed on local machines or servers, posing a similar challenge to the aforementioned models.


\subsection{Question Template}
Within the framework of this scholarly investigation, the question template holds profound significance. As expounded in Table \ref{tab:question_template_original}, the template is adeptly divided into two essential facets: the visual representation, embodied by the input image, and the accompanying inquiry. The former serves as a visual impetus for the evaluation of the LLMs, while the latter is presented directly to the LLMs to garner their feedback. This judiciously designed template plays a crucial role in formulating a comprehensive array of questions central to this research.

The dataset, in its entirety, encompasses 80 images, partitioned into two distinct classifications based on their intricacy: 40 images tailored for elementary queries and 40 for more advanced ones. The demarcation for this classification is anchored on the quantity of objects depicted and their spatial prominence within the image. Images featuring a maximum of five objects, wherein the principal object commands a substantial visual presence, fall under the elementary category. In contrast, images deviating from this standard are categorized as advanced.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Question Template}
    \label{tab:question_template_original}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{0.4\linewidth}|p{0.5\linewidth}|}

        & \begin{enumerate}
            \item Can you describe the spatial relationship between the tea table and the sofa?
            \item Can you describe the relevant spatial relationships between the objects on the tea table?
            \item Show the Reasoning Steps.
        \end{enumerate}\\
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Changes to original design}

In juxtaposition with the preliminary design, the finalized design underwent modifications in the question content. During the evaluation of the initial design, it was discerned that the questions lacked specificity, leading to imprecise responses. Particularly for the Bard model, its approach of generating an extensive array of potential answers introduced complexities in ascertaining the veracity of the responses.

Consequently, the design was refined to enhance the clarity and precision of the questions. The revised question template is delineated in Table \ref{tab:question_template}. This enhanced template, being more granular and precise, facilitates a clearer comprehension for the LLMs, thereby eliciting more accurate responses.

Regarding the experimental framework, three LLMs were selected for evaluation: Visual ChatGPT\cite{wu2023visual}, Bard, and MiniGPT-4\cite{zhu2023minigpt4}. The remainder of the experimental procedure aligns with the original design's blueprint.

            \item Is this black laptop on the left of the white laptop?
            \item Show me your specific reasoning steps that lead you to the answer, better in detailed explanation.
        \end{enumerate}\\

Based on the metrics, the MiniGPT-4 model manifests superior accuracy, succeeded by Visual ChatGPT and subsequently Bard. Notably, Visual ChatGPT's performance closely parallels that of MiniGPT-4. Furthermore, the accuracy across the two question sets remains relatively consistent for each model. However, it's evident that the accuracy for the 'Easy' question set surpasses that of the 'Hard' set for every model.

In the ensuing section, a comprehensive analysis of the three models will be undertaken, gleaning insights from the observed data. The evaluation will be partitioned into three distinct facets: Examination of Accuracy, Scrutiny of the Reasoning Process, and Deliberative Discussions.

\section{Examination of Accuracy}\label{chap:accuracy}
The detailed wrong answer analysis is documented by Table \ref{tab:error-easy} and \ref{tab:error-hard} in Appendix \ref{app:Extra_Tables}. The analysis is predicated on the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Left-Right Confusion:} The model confuses the left and right sides of two objects.
    \item \textbf{Recognition Error:} The model fails to recognize the object in the image or get the wrong object.
    \item \textbf{Judgement Fault in Front and Back:} The model fails to judge the front and back of the object or the spatial relationship between the front and back of the object.
    \item \textbf{Positional Fault:} The model gives the wrong spatial relationship between two objects and it is quite different from the image.
    \item \textbf{Item Misorientation:} The model gives the wrong spatial relationship because of getting a wrong orientation of the object.
    \item \textbf{Confused Expression:} The model gives a conflicting answer.
    \item \textbf{No Exact Answer:} The model gives an answer that is not sure or not exact.
    \item \textbf{No Response:} The model gives no response.
    \item \textbf{Logic Fault:} The model gives the wrong answer because of the wrong logic.
    \item \textbf{Vertical Fault:} The model gives the wrong answer in the vertical direction.
\end{itemize}

In the initial evaluation within the "Easy" category, all models grapple with challenges related to 'Left-Right Confusion' and 'Judgement Fault in Front and Back'. The issue of 'Left-Right Confusion', particularly concerning left-right distinctions, consistently manifested throughout this evaluation. The genesis of this anomaly remains enigmatic, surfacing sporadically; for instance, while some models accurately discerned the left-right orientation in question 1, they faltered in question 2. Various exemplifications of these discrepancies can be referenced in Appendix \ref{Easy}. To illustrate, in Question 9, accompanied by a visual aid in Figure \ref{fig:left-right}, the query 9-2 is posed as \textcolor{orange}{Is the cat on the right of the laptop?}. The subsequent responses are as follows:.

\textcolor{red}{Bard:} \textcolor{gray}{No, the cat is not on the right of the laptop.The cat is sitting on the left side of the laptop, ...}

\textcolor{red}{Visual ChatGPT:} \textcolor{gray}{Yes, the cat is on the right of the laptop.}

\textcolor{red}{MiniGPT-4:} \textcolor{gray}{No, the cat is on the left of the laptop.}

While Visual ChatGPT accurately responds to this particular query, similar discrepancies persist in subsequent questions.

      \caption{Image of Question 14}
      \label{fig:front-back}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The "Judgement Fault in Front and Back" emerges as a recurrent error. A quintessential instance of this is observed in Question 14, with the corresponding image depicted in Figure \ref{fig:front-back}. The query, 14-2, posed as \textcolor{orange}{Is the horse on the back of the vehicle?} elicited the following responses:

\textcolor{red}{Bard:} \textcolor{gray}{No, the horse is not on the back of the vehicle. The horse is in front of the vehicle, pulling it. The horse is attached to the vehicle by a harness, and the horse is walking forward, pulling the vehicle behind it. If the horse were on the back of the vehicle, it would be facing the opposite direction of the vehicle. The horse would also be attached to the vehicle by a different type of harness, such as a trailer hitch. The image you provided shows the horse in front of the vehicle, pulling it. This is a common sight in many parts of the world, where horses are used to pull vehicles such as carriages and carts.}

\textcolor{red}{Visual ChatGPT:} \textcolor{gray}{The image shows a red truck parked next to a horse. The horse is not on the back of the vehicle.}

\textcolor{red}{MiniGPT-4:} \textcolor{gray}{No, the horse is not on the back of the vehicle. The horse is standing in front of the vehicle, next to it. The vehicle is a red pickup truck with a bed liner. The sky is clear and there are clouds in the background. The image is a scene of a horse and a pickup truck in a grassy field.}

From these elucidations, it's palpable that while all models discern the presence of the horse and vehicle, they falter in accurately determining their spatial interrelation. Subsequent analysis of their reasoning, especially in the ensuing questions, underscores an initial misinterpretation of spatial dynamics. A comprehensive breakdown of their responses can be found in Appendix \ref{Easy}. This underscores a challenge faced by the models in accurately interpreting spatial relationships within images.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{../image set/hard/000000256309.jpg}
        \caption{Image of Question 64}

    \begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{../image set/easy/000000037024.jpg}
      \caption{Image of Question 6}
      \label{fig:vertical-fault}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The "Hard" category manifests a broader spectrum of discrepancies. The most recurrent inconsistency observed is the "Positional Fault". An illustrative instance is Question 64, accompanied by its visual representation in Figure \ref{fig:positional-fault}. The inquiry, 64-2, framed as \textcolor{orange}{Is this microwave behind the toaster?}, yielded the subsequent reactions:

\textcolor{red}{Bard:} \textcolor{gray}{No, the microwave in the image you provided is not behind the toaster. The microwave is on top of the toaster. It is not possible for the microwave to be behind the toaster because the microwave is larger than the toaster and it is in the foreground of the image. The microwave would have to be partially transparent in order to be behind the toaster.}

\textcolor{red}{Visual ChatGPT:} \textcolor{gray}{The microwave is not behind the toaster, it is located to the left of the toaster.}

\textcolor{red}{MiniGPT-4:} \textcolor{gray}{No, the microwave is in front of the toaster.}

From the elucidated responses, it becomes evident that the amalgamation of multiple objects in an image, especially when compounded by partial occlusion, introduces a degree of interpretative ambiguity. All models exhibit challenges in discerning the relative spatial relationships of objects within the visual context, potentially leading to misinterpretations.

Throughout the evaluation, several consistent anomalies emerged. The models frequently manifested "Item Misorientation", "Recognition Error", and "Confused Expression". Delving deeper: "Item Misorientation" likely originates from the model's object recognition subsystem, which, while capable of identifying the object, grapples with determining its precise orientation. Both "Recognition Error" and "Confused Expression" may have a shared genesis, potentially arising from the intricate nature of images laden with numerous objects, thereby taxing the model's recognition faculties. This postulation gains traction considering that both "Recognition Error" and "Confused Expression" are predominantly evident in the "Hard" category.

In addtionally, Bard consistently displays an anomaly termed "Vertical Fault". It seemingly discerns spatial relationships, particularly 'above' and 'below', predominantly when the centroids of two objects are vertically congruent. A representative instance is delineated in Question 6, visually depicted in Figure \ref{fig:vertical-fault}. The query 6-2 is framed as \textcolor{orange}{Is the blue bag above the yellow package?}, eliciting the following response

\textcolor{red}{Bard:} \textcolor{gray}{No, the blue bag is not above the yellow package. The blue bag and the yellow package are both sitting on the bench, and there is no space between the two objects. Therefore, the blue bag cannot be above the yellow package.}

Upon comprehensive analysis of accuracy metrics, MiniGPT-4 emerges as the most consistent model, delivering cogent responses in the majority of scenarios. Visual ChatGPT ranks second, generally providing logical answers; however, its performance exhibits variability during testing, occasionally failing to respond. Bard, while demonstrating some stability, lags in consistency. Its responses, though occasionally reasonable, lack the precision and quality exhibited by the other two models, with answers ranging from imprecise to entirely erroneous.


\section{Scrutiny of the Reasoning Process}\label{chap:reasoning}

Within the second dimension, the objective is to scrutinize the models' reasoning mechanisms. This analysis will individually consider each model due to the distinct nature of their responses. A representative answer for this dimension is derived from Question 17, selected primarily because all models correctly ascertain in question 17-2 that the boy is positioned in front of the pizza. Further elucidation on the reasoning steps can be found in Appendix \ref{Easy} and \ref{Hard}. The visual context for Question 17 is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:reasoning-process}. When posed with the query 17-3, phrased as \textcolor{orange}{Show me your specific reasoning steps that lead you to the answer, better in detailed explanation.}, eliciting the following response:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{../image set/easy/000000089367.jpg}
    \caption{Image of Question 17}
    \label{fig:reasoning-process}
\end{figure}

\textcolor{red}{Bard:} \textcolor{gray}{Sure, here are my specific reasoning steps that lead me to the answer: I first looked at the image and saw that the boy was facing a pizza on a table. I then considered the question "Is the pizza in front of the boy?". I realized that the answer to this question depends on the definition of "in front of".
I decided to use the following definition of "in front of": "located in front of or facing someone or something". Based on this definition, I concluded that the pizza was in front of the boy, because the boy was facing the pizza and his hands were on the table, near the pizza.
Here is a more detailed explanation of each step:
Step 1: I looked at the image and saw that the boy was facing a pizza on a table. This was the first piece of evidence that led me to the conclusion that the pizza was in front of the boy.
Step 2: I considered the question "Is the pizza in front of the boy?". I realized that the answer to this question depends on the definition of "in front of". This was an important step in my reasoning process, because it helped me to clarify the meaning of the question.
Step 3: I decided to use the following definition of "in front of": "located in front of or facing someone or something". This was a reasonable definition to use, because it was consistent with the way that the word "in front of" is commonly used.
Step 4: Based on this definition, I concluded that the pizza was in front of the boy, because the boy was facing the pizza and his hands were on the table, near the pizza. This was the final step in my reasoning process.
I hope this explanation is clear and helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions.}

\textcolor{red}{Visual ChatGPT:} \textcolor{gray}{The image provided is of a boy holding a pizza. From the description, it is clear that the pizza is in front of the boy. To confirm this, I used the Get Photo Description tool to observe the image and confirm that the boy is indeed holding the pizza in his hands.}

\textcolor{red}{MiniGPT-4:} \textcolor{gray}{Sure, here are the specific reasoning steps that led me to the answer:
1. The image shows a young boy sitting at a table with a large pizza in front of him.
2. The pizza is on a large round plate, which suggests that it is a personal-sized pizza.
3. The boy is using a fork to cut into the pizza, which suggests that he is eating the pizza.
4. The boy is wearing a red and white plaid shirt, which suggests that he is in a casual setting.
5. The tablecloth is white and the walls of the room are painted a light blue, which suggests that the setting is a restaurant or cafe.
6. There are a few small white flowers on the table in front of the boy, which suggests that the setting is a nice, upscale restaurant or cafe.
7. The pizza appears to be a pepperoni pizza, which is a common type of pizza.
8. Based on these observations, it is likely that the pizza is in front of the boy.}

Upon a meticulous examination of the provided responses, the reasoning aptitudes of the models appear suboptimal. Visual ChatGPT's rationale is notably cursory, furnishing a succinct declaration that merely acknowledges an object's existence. MiniGPT-4, albeit slightly more insightful than Visual ChatGPT, delivers explanations that are wanting in precision and profundity, often defaulting to basic image annotations. Bard's elucidations emerge as the most articulate, mirroring a semblance of human-like deductive reasoning. Nonetheless, even Bard's justifications, though comprehensive, could be further refined for clarity and depth. Furthermore, the models' reasoning approach seems more inclined towards validating their conclusions rather than explicating the spatial interrelation between objects. This trend is particularly pronounced across all three models, especially when their responses to the second query are erroneous.

\section{Deliberative Discussions}\label{chap:discussion}

In the subsequent sections, specifically \ref{chap:accuracy} and \ref{chap:reasoning}, we have embarked on an evaluative journey. Now, it is imperative to delve into a comprehensive discourse on the derived outcomes.

Several quandaries merit discussion within this domain. Foremost among them is the "Left-Right Confusion." Pinpointing the genesis of this issue proves elusive, as no salient indicators precipitate it. For illustration, while the inaugural query from the set might witness the model accurately discerning the left-right relationship, the subsequent query, post the integration of a lead word, manifests an erroneous response. This stark discrepancy suggests potential anomalies within the model's inferential framework, rendering its conclusions inconsistent or capricious.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
  \subfloat[a\label{2a}]{%
       \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{./pic/left-right-example.png}}
    \\

  \caption{Examples of spatial relationship (a)Example of simple left-right relationship (b)Example of simple up-down relationship (c)Example of complex relationship}
  \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

Another conundrum confronting the models pertains to their rigid interpretation of spatial relationships. When objects, as depicted in Figures \ref{2a} and \ref{2b}, share proximity and align along a common axis, the models adeptly elucidate their relationship. However, when objects are spatially distanced, as in Figure \ref{2c}, the models grapple with discerning their interrelation. This rigidity contrasts with real-world spatial dynamics, which are inherently fluid and contingent on perspective. For instance, in Fig \ref{2c}, the objects' spatial relationship could be construed as either left-right or up-down, yet the model's verdict remains nebulous.

Moreover, intrinsic limitations plague the models. Bard's response strategy lacks clarity; Visual ChatGPT exhibits volatility, occasionally faltering in its responses; and while MiniGPT-4 is commendable in its responsiveness, its inferential methodology is suboptimal.

Furthermore, the models' reasoning paradigms are found wanting. Their inability to elucidate a lucid and granular reasoning trajectory is evident. The majority exhibit a paucity of analytical prowess, proffering rudimentary conclusions bereft of depth, thereby obfuscating their inferential processes. Additionally, their reasoning lacks the intuitive human touch, devoid of pivotal insights that naturally guide conclusions.

In summation, when assessing LLMs in the realm of Visual Spatial Reasoning, several areas warrant enhancement:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A more adaptive approach to spatial relationship discernment.
    \item Augmentation of the reasoning process to emulate human-like depth and nuance.
    \item Refinement of object recognition capabilities to bolster accuracy and stability.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chap:conclusions}
In this research endeavor, we delved into the Visual Spatial Reasoning competencies of LLMs, with a particular emphasis on their efficacy in VQA tasks. By architecting and executing a robust experimental paradigm, we meticulously assessed three preeminent LLMs: Visual ChatGPT, Bard, and MiniGPT-4. Our evaluation pivoted around two distinct question sets: Easy and Hard, each encompassing 40 queries. These queries were crafted to probe the models' Visual Spatial Reasoning prowess, with the Easy set spotlighting less intricate visuals and the Hard set showcasing more convoluted imagery. The assessment entailed presenting these questions to the models and subsequently dissecting their responses. These responses underwent scrutiny based on criteria like accuracy, logical reasoning, and elucidation. The resultant data was then synthesized to discern patterns, trajectories, and impediments in LLMs' Visual Spatial Reasoning capacities. Drawing from this analysis, we have elucidated the inherent strengths and constraints of contemporary LLMs in Visual Spatial Reasoning tasks, suggesting prospective pathways for amplifying their proficiencies.
