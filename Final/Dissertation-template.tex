%%%%  INTRODUCTION

\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}
 
This project describes the greatest invention since sliced bread, 
namely twice-sliced bread.  


\section{Scope}

\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem}

\section{Approach}

See Fig.~\ref{fig:first} for a nice pretty picture that I have included
in my dissertation.  


\section {Outcome}



%%%%  BACKGROUND

\chapter{Background}\label{chap:background}

We base some of our results on the previous work of other authors~\cite{A1, Someone}.


%%%%  DESIGN

\chapter{Design}\label{chap:design}

In this chapter, we will outline the design of the software that was
developed in this project.  

\section{Original design}\label{chap:first_design}
The original design document that was submitted can be found in 
Appendix~\ref{app:Original_design}.  The idea of that design
was as follows....


\section{Changes to original design}


%%%%  IMPLEMENTATION

\chapter{Implementation}\label{chap:implementation}


%%%%  This figure uses the "tikz" package mentioned earlier to
%%%%  draw it.  Obviously there are other ways to draw pictures,
%%%%  including native LaTeX commands for doing so.  I am merely
%%%%  providing an example here.  The "label" is how you can 
%%%%  add a label to refer to the figure in the body of the document.
